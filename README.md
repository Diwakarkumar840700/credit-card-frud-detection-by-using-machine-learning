Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing transaction data, the model can predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. Early detection of fraudulent transactions is crucial for reducing financial losses and ensuring the security of credit card users.

Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant challenge in the financial sector, with millions of dollars lost each year due to fraudulent transactions. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, helping to prevent fraud and protect users.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions, labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. The features in the dataset have been anonymized to protect sensitive information.

Dataset Source
The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle or other reputable sources.

Data Structure
Features: The dataset contains 30 features, including:
V1, V2, ..., V28: Principal components obtained using PCA to protect confidentiality.
Time: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
Amount: The transaction amount.
Label:
0: Legitimate transaction
1: Fraudulent transaction
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is essential to enhance the model's ability to detect fraud. In this project, the following techniques are used:

Scaling: Features such as Amount and Time are scaled using standardization.
Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or other techniques may be used to reduce dimensionality and remove noise.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or undersampling are employed to address the class imbalance in the dataset.
Model Selection
Several machine learning algorithms are tested to identify the best-performing model. These may include:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
XGBoost
Neural Networks
The final model is selected based on its performance on the validation set.

Training
The model is trained using the following process:

Split the dataset: The dataset is split into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20).
Train the model: The selected model is trained on the training set.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search or random search is used to find the optimal hyperparameters.
